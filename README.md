The purpose of this project is to detect human faces in a video stream from a webcam in real-time and highlight them by drawing rectangles around detected faces. This is achieved by utilizing OpenCV’s Haar Cascade Classifier. The system continuously captures video, processes the frames, and detects faces. It is designed to run in real time and stops when the user presses the 'q' key. 
The key components of this project are:  Capturing real-time video using a webcam.  Converting the video frames to grayscale to optimize detection.  Using OpenCV's Haar Cascade algorithm to detect faces.  Displaying the video with rectangles drawn around the detected faces.
